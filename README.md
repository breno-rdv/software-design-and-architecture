# Software Design and Architecture principals
Before entering any design and principals we should understand the program paradigms and their main concepts.

## Object-Oriented Programming
It is a paradigm in which real-world problems are modeled into objects, having four pillars:
- Abstraction
The ability to abstract real-world problems in new types.
- Encapsulation
The ability to expose/hide methods and attributes from external world.
- Inheritance
The ability to extend characterists from an existing object to another.
- Polymorphism
The ability to have the same object types behaving in different ways.
